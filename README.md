#reverser
* * *

Fork of the [android-ocr](https://github.com/rmtheis/android-ocr) project. Reverses text recognized using the camera viewfinder, and renders the reversed text on top of the viewfinder.

This project is a temporary test project, and there are some problems with the code. Please avoid using this project, and use the android-ocr project instead.
